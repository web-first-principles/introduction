<h3>Project Idea</h3>
</div>

  Todays web programming is complex and can be really confusing especially for people who just getting started.<br>
It involved a lot of moving parts, to build next-generation SPA applications. <br> Just think about all this busy words like `Module Loader`, `Tree Shaking`, `Build System`, `Components` they can scary even developers with professional experience. <br>

That's why I decided to run this project. We will cover all this stuffs in `first principles` manner that means instead of messing aroung specific tools like `Webpack`, `Gulp` will we cover underlying basic concepts and rebuild similar (but less functional) tools for deeper understanding. Because when you know core concepts that lying underneath it's a trivial task to learn new `API` of next `hot tool (TM)`

  Assuming that you just know nothing more than basic **JavaScript**, this project aims to teach you everything you need to craft modern web applications.

<h3>What the heck is "first principles" method</h3>
</div>
<p>Speaking formarly learning from first principles is a way of self teaching, where instead of finding analogies of something you deconstruct problem into layers starting from the lowest and getting higher. Think about it as a pyramid where in the bottom are the most fundamental thinks and moving upper you will interact with more and more abstactions.<br></p>
<p>It is not a new "hot" method of learning, it is the way of how you should think about certain problems as well.<br>
One of famous adaptors of this method is Elon Musk, who is in my opinion genius of our time, who worked on `SpaceX`, `PayPal`, `Tesla` to say few.

<br>

Also this method was actively adopted in some CS courses all over that world.
I strongly recommend to check them:
 * [NAND to Tetrist (Build modern computer from the basic logic gate to os and compiler)](http://www.nand2tetris.org/)
 * [The computing technologies inside smartphone (Understand undelying computing systems of your device)](https://www.edx.org/course/computing-technology-inside-smartphone-cornellx-engri1210x-0)

<h3>Content</h3>
</div>

Before we begin, I'd like to prepare you that building all this tools is not really a trivial tasks, so be patient to yourself.<br> It's quite long journey, but belive me you will be excited about what you will learn.<br> We will cover thing in specific order, that I think the most comfortable to follow, but you can use all stuffs as separate components.

 1. [JavaScript module loaders]()
 2. [Build tools in front-end world]()
 3. TBD
 4. Programming languages
 5. [SPA frameworks]()
 5. [Component as a main building block]()
 6. TBD
