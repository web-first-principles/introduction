<h3>Project Idea</h3>
</div>

  Todays web programming is complex and can be really confusing especially for people who just getting started.<br>
It involved a lot of moving parts, to build next-generation SPA applications. <br> Just think about all this busy words like `Module Loader`, `Tree Shaking`, `Build System`, `Components` they can scary even developers with professional experience. <br>

That's why I decided to run this project. We will cover all this stuffs in `first principles` manner that means instead of messing aroung specific tools like `Webpack`, `Gulp` will we cover underlying basic concepts and rebuild similar (but less functional) tools for deeper understanding. Because when you know core concepts that lying underneath it's a trivial task to learn new `API` of next `hot tool (TM)`

  Assuming that you just know nothing more than basic **JavaScript**, this project aims to teach you everything you need to craft modern web applications.

Before we begin, I'd like to prepare you that building all this tools is not really a trivial tasks, so be patient to yourself. It's quite long journey, but belive me you will be excited about what you will learn.<br> We will cover thing in specific order, that I think the most comfortable to follow, but you can use all stuffs as separate components.

 1. [JavaScript module loaders]()
 2. [Build tools in front-end world]()
 3. TBD
 4. Programming languages
 5. [SPA frameworks]()
 5. [Component as a main building block]()
 6. TBD
